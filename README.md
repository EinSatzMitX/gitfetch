# gitfetch

A [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) inspired tool for fetching
github profiles in the terminal

## Note

It is recommended to pass in a github token via the `--token MY_TOKEN` argument.
You can use gitfetch without it, however you may be rate limited, due to the
fact of github only accepting 60 requests per **Hour**.

## Building

```Rust
fn main(){
    todo!()
}
```
